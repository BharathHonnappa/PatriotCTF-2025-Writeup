# Matrix Reconstruction - CTF Writeup

## Challenge Overview

This cryptography challenge involves recovering a matrix-based PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator) and using it to decrypt a ciphertext. The system uses a linear recurrence relation over GF(2) (binary field).

**Given:**
- Ciphertext (35 bytes)
- 40 leaked keystream states
- PRNG model: `S[n+1] = A*S[n] XOR B` over GF(2)

**Goal:** Recover matrix A and vector B, then decrypt the ciphertext.

## Understanding the Cryptosystem

### The PRNG Model

The keystream generator uses a linear feedback system:
```
S[n+1] = A × S[n] ⊕ B
```

Where:
- `S[n]` is a 32-bit state
- `A` is a 32×32 binary matrix
- `B` is a 32-bit binary vector
- Operations are in GF(2) (XOR arithmetic)

### Encryption Scheme

The plaintext is encrypted using XOR with bytes extracted from the PRNG states:
```
Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Keystream
```

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Matrix Reconstruction

With 40 consecutive states, we can reconstruct matrix A and vector B by solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).

**Key Insight:** Each bit position in the output can be treated as an independent linear equation.

For each output bit position `i` (0-31):
```
S[n+1][i] = (A[i][0] × S[n][0]) ⊕ (A[i][1] × S[n][1]) ⊕ ... ⊕ (A[i][31] × S[n][31]) ⊕ B[i]
```

This gives us 32 unknowns (the i-th row of A plus B[i]) per equation. With 40 states, we have 39 transitions, providing 39 equations per bit position - more than enough to solve for the 33 unknowns.

### Step 2: Gaussian Elimination in GF(2)

The solution implements Gaussian elimination for binary fields:

```python
def solve_for_row(equations, targets):
    # Augmented matrix [A | b]
    aug = [eq + [target] for eq, target in zip(equations, targets)]
    
    # Forward elimination
    for col in range(n):
        # Find pivot (any row with 1 in current column)
        # Swap to diagonal position
        # Eliminate below using XOR
    
    # Back substitution
    # Extract solution vector
```

### Step 3: State Extension

Once A and B are recovered, we can generate additional states forward:

```python
for _ in range(1000):
    current_state = (A × current_state) ⊕ B
```

This extends our keystream beyond the 40 leaked states.

### Step 4: Keystream Extraction

Each 32-bit state can provide 4 bytes of keystream material:
```python
bytes_from_state = [
    (state >> 0) & 0xFF,
    (state >> 8) & 0xFF,
    (state >> 16) & 0xFF,
    (state >> 24) & 0xFF
]
```

### Step 5: Pattern Matching

Since CTF flags typically start with `pctf{`, we can:

1. Calculate required keystream bytes:
   ```
   K[i] = Ciphertext[i] ⊕ 'pctf{'[i]
   ```

2. Search through all state bytes to find matching patterns

3. Try different byte extraction sequences until we find valid plaintext

## The Solution

Running the script reveals:

```
Matrix A reconstructed!
Vector B: 0 (0x00000000)
```

Note that B = 0, simplifying the recurrence to just `S[n+1] = A × S[n]`.

The verification shows perfect reconstruction:
```
State 0->1: ✓
State 1->2: ✓
State 2->3: ✓
...
```

After searching through byte positions and patterns:

```
🚨 FLAG FOUND: b'pctf{mAtr1x_r3construct?on_!s_fu4n}'
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linear Recurrences are Vulnerable**: When consecutive states leak, linear recurrence relations over GF(2) can be completely recovered using linear algebra.

2. **GF(2) Arithmetic**: Binary field operations (XOR-based) make the system linear and solvable with Gaussian elimination.

3. **Sufficient Data**: With 40 states and only 33 unknowns per row, we had redundant equations, making the system overdetermined and more robust.

4. **State Extension**: Once the PRNG is recovered, we can generate unlimited keystream, completely breaking the cipher.

## Flag

```
pctf{mAtr1x_r3construct?on_!s_fu4n}
```

The flag itself is a playful reference to "Matrix Reconstruction is fun" - which it certainly was!
