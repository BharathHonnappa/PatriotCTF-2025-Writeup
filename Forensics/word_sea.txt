### **Writeup: PCTF - Word Sea Adventures**

**Category:** Forensics / Steganography
**Tools Used:** `binwalk`, `steghide`, `strings`, `cat`
**Challenge Prompt:** The challenge file was a Word document named `word_sea_adventures.docx` containing a story about SpongeBob.

#### **1. Initial Analysis & The Critical Hint**

The first step was to open the document. While it contained a fun SpongeBob story, the text itself provided a crucial forensic clue:

> “Word documents share a similar secret: although they appear as a single file, they are really like little “zipped-up” bottles of fun.”

This is a direct reference to the Office Open XML (OOXML) format. Files like `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pptx` are essentially ZIP archives containing XML files for the document's structure and content, along with a `media` folder for embedded images and other assets. The challenge was clearly pointing us to look inside the document's container.

#### **2. File Structure Analysis with Binwalk**

Instead of viewing the file as a document, we treated it as a binary container. Using `binwalk`, a tool for analyzing and extracting embedded files, we inspected its internal structure.

**Command:**
```bash
binwalk word_sea_adventures.docx
```

**Findings:**
The output confirmed the ZIP archive structure. However, among the standard files, three images with non-standard, manually inserted names stood out:
- `crab.jpg`
- `sponge.jpg`
- `squid.jpg`

In a typical Word document, images are automatically named like `image1.png` or `image2.jpeg`. These custom names were a clear indicator that they were the focus of the challenge.

#### **3. Extracting the Artifacts**

To retrieve these suspicious images, we used `binwalk` to extract all embedded files.

**Command:**
```bash
binwalk --extract --dd=".*" word_sea_adventures.docx
```

This command created a directory (typically `_word_sea_adventures.docx.extracted`) containing the entire contents of the ZIP archive. Navigating to the `word/media/` folder confirmed the presence of our three target files: `crab.jpg`, `sponge.jpg`, and `squid.jpg`.

#### **4. Steganography Analysis**

With the images extracted, the next step was to find the hidden flag. We started with a simple check for cleartext data.

**Method 1: Strings (Failed)**
We ran the `strings` command combined with `grep` to search for the flag format.

**Command:**
```bash
strings squid.jpg | grep "pctf"
```
This returned no results, confirming the flag was not hidden in plain text within the image.

**Method 2: Steghide (Success)**
We then turned to `steghide`, a common tool for hiding data in JPEG and BMP files. We first used the `info` command to check each image for embedded data without extracting it.

**Command & Findings:**
```bash
steghide info crab.jpg
# Output: Embedded file "decoy2.txt" (encrypted with Rijndael-128, CBC)

steghide info sponge.jpg
# Output: Embedded file "decoy1.txt" (encrypted with Rijndael-128, CBC)

steghide info squid.jpg
# Output: Embedded file "flag.txt" (106.0 Byte)
```

This was the breakthrough. `crab.jpg` and `sponge.jpg` contained encrypted decoy files, but `squid.jpg` contained `flag.txt`. When prompted for a passphrase, pressing Enter (using an empty passphrase) was accepted, meaning no password was needed to extract the data.

#### **5. Flag Capture**

We proceeded to extract the payload from `squid.jpg`.

**Command:**
```bash
steghide extract -sf squid.jpg
```
After confirming the extraction with an empty passphrase, the file `flag.txt` was written to the current directory.

The final step was to read the file and capture the flag.

**Command:**
```bash
cat flag.txt
```

**Flag Found:**
`pctf{st3g0_squ1dward_d0cument}`

#### **Conclusion**

This challenge was a classic example of "forensics by the book":
1.  **Heed the Hints:** The story itself contained the critical clue to treat the DOCX as an archive.
2.  **Inspect the Structure:** Using `binwalk` revealed anomalous, custom-named files.
3.  **Extract and Analyze:** After extraction, standard steganography tools like `steghide` were the key to finding the hidden flag, especially when a blank passphrase was all that was needed.

The flag `pctf{st3g0_squ1dward_d0cument}` perfectly encapsulates the solution: using steganography (`stego`) within a Squidward-themed document.
