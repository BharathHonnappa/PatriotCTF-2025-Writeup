ReadMyNote - CTF Writeup
Challenge Information
Challenge Name: ReadMyNote
Category: Reverse Engineering
Difficulty: Easy/Medium
Tools Used: radare2, Python
Flag Format: pctf{...}

Challenge Description
The challenge provides a Windows PE32+ executable obfuscated with Qengine 2.0. The description hints that everything needed is within the binary and it can be solved either dynamically or statically.

Initial Analysis
First, we examined the binary using various approaches:

Static Analysis with radare2
bash
r2 ReadMyNote.exe
[0x14000ef00]> aaa
[0x14000ef00]> iz
This revealed all strings in the binary, including an interesting encoded string:

text
19  0x0000f440 0x140010640 29  30   .rdata  ascii ufqc~LZI5S6ZR4KA5R!Z=6g3a=`2x
The Breakthrough
The string ufqc~LZI5S6ZR4KA5R!Z=6g3a=2x` immediately stood out because:

It didn't look like normal text or random data

It was exactly where we'd expect an obfuscated flag to be hidden

The length was reasonable for a flag

Encoding Analysis
We noticed that if we XOR the first character u (0x75) with p (0x70) from the expected flag format pctf{, we get:

text
0x75 (u) XOR 0x70 (p) = 0x05
This suggested the entire string might be XOR encoded with key 0x05.

Decoding Process
Using radare2's Python integration, we decoded the string:

python
[0x14000ef00]> !python3 -c "data = bytes.fromhex('756671637e4c5a493553365a52344b413552215a3d366733613d603278'); print(''.join(chr(b ^ 0x5) for b in data))"
Output: pctf{I_L0V3_W1ND0W$_83b6d8e7}

The Flag
pctf{I_L0V3_W1ND0W$_83b6d8e7}

Solution Summary
Identified the encoded string in the .rdata section using radare2's string analysis

Recognized XOR encoding by comparing the first character with the expected flag format

Discovered the XOR key (0x05) through simple cryptographic analysis

Decoded the entire string to reveal the flag

Key Insights
The challenge used simple XOR obfuscation despite being protected with Qengine 2.0

The flag was statically embedded in the binary, making dynamic analysis unnecessary

Basic cryptographic principles (XOR properties) were sufficient to solve the challenge

The flag content I_L0V3_W1ND0W$ humorously references the Windows platform the binary was designed for

Tools and Commands Used
radare2: For static analysis and string extraction

Python: For XOR decoding operations

Hex analysis: To verify the encoding method

This challenge demonstrated that even with commercial obfuscation tools, simple encoding schemes can be easily broken with basic reverse engineering techniques.
